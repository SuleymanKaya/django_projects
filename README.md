# Advanced Blog Website
In this Django project, I builded a Blog application with Django that allows users to create, edit, and delete posts. The homepage will list all blog posts, and there will be a dedicated detail page for each individual post. Django is capable of making more advanced stuff but making a blog is an excellent first step to get a good grasp over the framework. The purpose of this project is to get details idea about the working of Django from the idea and design stage to the final delivery. While developing the project, I used many different technologies such as Postgres, AWS, EC2, S3, Route 53, Gunicorn, Nginx, Sentry, Email, Logging, Pipenv, Environ, Git.
