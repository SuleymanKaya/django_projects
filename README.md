# Advanced Blog Website
In this tutorial, weâ€™ll build a Blog application with Django that allows users to create, edit, and delete posts. The homepage will list all blog posts, and there will be a dedicated detail page for each individual post. Django is capable of making more advanced stuff but making a blog is an excellent first step to get a good grasp over the framework. The purpose of this chapter is to get a general idea about the working of Django.
