# To-Do List Application Project Using Django with Python

In this project I created a basic To-Do application using the Django framework.

A To-Do list is a list that you can keep to put all of the tasks that you need to complete on a given day. It can be very useful for managing time, by planning your day ahead of time, and prioritizing activities.
This is an app where you can add new items to the list by clicking a button, and you can delete items from the list once the work gets completed.
